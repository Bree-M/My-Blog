#knowing data types is knowing how to control your data
#variables are storage containers and data types are the ingredients.
#int,float,str,bool,list,tuples,dict and sets are the various datatypes.
#Data types tell Python what your data can do. Treat them right, and theyâ€™ll carry your whole program.
